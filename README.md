# hcclib

This library is a collection of different classes that I have built over the years to do various things. I think I have the licenses all updated to GPL.

I do not intend to add any new classes without unit testing, but some of the older classes do not yet have any. They will eventually be added. I will also eventually get documentation added, but that is a bit in the future.
